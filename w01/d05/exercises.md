## Learning Objectives
  1. Get introduced to functions in JavaScript
  2. Get introduced to callbacks in JavaScript
  3. Animations in Canvas

#### Exercise: Double
Write a function that takes a number and returns its double

#### Exercise: Find the maximum
Write a function that takes 2 numbers as parameters and returns the maximum of those numbers.

Call this function 3 times with different parameters and log the results to the console.

**Bonus:** Make it take in 3 parameters.

#### Exercise: Find the area of a rectangle
Write a function that takes the width and height of a rectangle as parameters and returns the area of the rectangle. The area of a rectangle is ```width * height```.

Call this function 3 times with different parameters and log the results to the console.


**Bonus1:** Make another function to return the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter is ```width + width + height + height```

**Bonus2:** Make another function to return the area of a circle. The area of a circle is ```Math.PI * radius * radius```

#### Further Exercises
#### Exercise: Manage a Zoo
You are managing a zoo.  The zoo has the following animals: elephant, alligator, panda, lion, monkey, koala, tiger, t-rex, puffins, dodo, Crawford, and penguins.

Create functions for adding an animal to the zoo, removing an animal from the zoo, switching the positions of 2 animals from the zoo, sorting the animals by name, and reverse sorting them.

**Here's the catch**
  - Your function must take the zoo array as a **parameter** and return a brand new array.

You must:
  1. Add a kangaroo to the zoo.
  2. Remove the dodo.
  3. Switch the tiger and Crawford.
  4. Sort the animals by name.
  5. Reverse the array.

You may want to consult the Mozilla documentation for [arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array).


## Callbacks

#### Say Hello to my Little Friend

Print ```Say Hello to my Little Friend``` to the terminal 2 seconds from now.

#### Say Hello again to my Little Friend

Print ```Say Hello Again to my Little Friend``` to the terminal **every** 2 seconds.

## Canvas

#### Redraw the canvas every 20 ms

Take a canvas drawing of a square, and redraw it every 20 ms with a slightly different position.
