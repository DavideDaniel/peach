## Learning Objectives
  1. Understand Looping, particularly a while loop, in Javascript
  2. Dive deeper into Strings
  3. Learn about the HTML5 Canvas element

## Loops

#### Exercise: Awkward date

Write a javascript application that logs "I'm fine, how are you?" 5 times.

** Bonus: ** Log it x times.

#### Exercise: FizzBuzz in a loop
Write a javascript application that logs all numbers from 1 - 100. If a number is divisible by 3 log "Fizz" instead of the number. If a number is divisible by 5 log "Buzz" instead of the number. If a number is divisible by 3 and 5 log "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

#### Exercise: Print the Vowels

Write a javascript application that takes a string as an argument and logs every vowel in the string.

** Bonus: ** Build a new string with the vowels.

#### Exercise: Reverse a string

Write a javascript application that takes a string as an argument and returns that string in reverse.

## Math.random()

#### Exercise: Guess the number game

Write a javascript application that takes an integer as an argument and creates a random number. If the random number and the argument are the same log "success!". Otherwise, log "sorry, we were looking for " the random number.

## Canvas

#### Exercise: Draw a square in each corner

Change the javascript in the boiler plate so there is a 50x50 squre in each corner of the canvas.

#### Exercise: Draw 4 squares in each of these squares

Next, modify the previous exercise so there is a 25x25 square in the middle of each of the 4 squares. Don't forget to change the colors!

#### Exercise: Draw a certain number of squares

Use the prompt command to get a number from the user; draw that many squares.  Hint: use a loop to change the location of each square.

#### Put a square in a random place

Change the javascript in the boiler plate so each time the page is refreshed there is a square in a random place.

#### Random colors using rgb

Colors can be represented in a variety of ways. Instead of using a color name in a string, use the RGB format, which looks like this:

    "rgb(100, 50, 100)"

Change the javascript in the boiler plate so when the page is refreshed the color of the square changes.

** Bonus: ** Use hex colors instead.

##Even further bonuses!

#### Bonus: Palindrome
