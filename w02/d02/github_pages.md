##Github Pages
You can use Github to host a website for your account.

1. create a repository on Github named "username.github.io" where "username" is your **GITHUB USERNAME**.  
2. Go to your home directory `cd ~` and make a directory called `github_pages`.  
3. run `cd github_pages`.  
4. While in your `github_pages` directory, clone your new repository:  
`git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io`  
5. Copy your canvas files into the username.github.io directory that was created
(Make sure that your html file is named `index.html`).

6. `cd` into the username.github.io directory and run `git add .` and  `git commit -m "Initial Github Page commit."`

7. run `git push origin master`

8. Wait a few minutes and you should be able to go to username.github.io in your browser and see your canvas animation!

Any additional tweaks you make to your canvas project can be pushed to that repo like any other Github project.
